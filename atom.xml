        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I restarted a plan which aims to help my English skills. In the future, I will upload different kinds of videos with transcripts translated by myself on bilibili. I hope that this would help people who can’t not see excellent videos on youtube and can also practice my translation skills.</p>
<p>Today I don’t play any games. I realized that Playing games myself is not as interesting as watching other people playing. Maybe that’s why a lot of people watch livestream on twitch. I found this out when I started playing CSGO. It’s really a hard game that cost me a lot of time. I can’t even shot accurately. Also the strategies are hard for me. But I really love watching competitions. I find it’s really exciting.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I wake up so late that I didn’t have breakfast. it is the first day of my winter vacation. I hang out with my dad. Also I had my hair cut. I always thought that I should change a hair style, but I don’t know what kind of style I should have.</p>
<p>I got my new keyboard which had nice style. I really love the sound when I was touched. It feels much better to play CSGO with this new keyboard.</p>
<p>I really want to find some nice people to play game with. But I don’t play any popular games. I have tried to play LOL but I find it’s not my cup of tea. How can I find friends in games?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is so boring. Almost all of my roommates went out to have fun. But I don’t have any places to go. So the only thing I can do is staying in the dormitory and playing CS:GO. But I don’t think it’s a good way to relax. I really want to go outside and have fun. But every time I went out, I always found I still didn’t know where to go. Maybe it’s because that I have stayed at home for so long that I have forgiven the feeling of staying outside. In the summer vocation, I had planned to go for a travel with my friends. However, due  to their busy schedule, we miss the chance to travel together.</p>
<p>I don’t think that I will have a lot of spare time in university and I don’t have any money too. I really want to try a lot of new things. But I don’t have chance. I think I am unfortunate.</p>
